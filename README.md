# projet_app

This project aim is to test diverse GUI Frameworks in Python. 

It is divided in 3 part :

## Form

The idea is to create a form using a GUI (PySimpleGUI).

## 2D game

The aim is to create a mini 2D game (isometric) rts like, and to use the framework to be more efficient doing it (PySimpleGUI and/or Ursina engine).

## 3D game

The idea is almost the same as for the 2D game, to create a game and evaluate the feasibility.

We will test Ursina Engine and Pandas 3D framework.
